# Apollo-Tasks

This repository contains the answers to the Assessment Project for Applicants of the DPS Cloud Group.
## Running

I used the [EE-Demo](https://github.com/Apollo-Core/EE-Demo) to run the final application of the tasks. Each task folder includes a JSON input file, an AFCL YAML file, and a JSON IBM resource mapping file. After importing the EE-Demo project to the Eclipse, I run launches/demoSix.launch, and then I passed mentioned file to the Apollo. by clicking on Apollo's Run Button, everything will start. Resources are allocated to functions and functions are executed in order.
